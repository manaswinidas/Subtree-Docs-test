# Subtree-Docs-test

This is a test repository to check the syncing of GitHub wiki and GitBook content for documentation

## Install gitbook dependencies

`npm install`

## Build and run kogito-wiki gitbook in your local environment

### Create the directories and files for a book from its SUMMARY.md file (if existing, in this case it is inside the kogito-wiki directory) using:
`cd kogito-wiki`

`gitbook init`

### You can serve the kogito-wiki repository as a gitbook using:
`gitbook serve`

### Or simply build the static website using:
`gitbook build`
