# Subtree-Docs-test

This is a test repository to check the syncing of GitHub wiki and GitBook content for documentation using git subtree. Make sure you have it installed before running this repository.

## Run 

### Install gitbook dependencies

`npm install`

### You can serve the kogito-wiki repository as a gitbook using:

`gitbook serve`

## Build and run kogito-wiki gitbook in your local environment

### Create the directories and files for a book from its SUMMARY.md file using:
`gitbook init`
This creates a `_book` folder which contains the generated HTML of all Asciidoc files. An example is present in this repository(you needn't execute this step, this has already been done for you).

### Or simply build the static website using:
`gitbook build`

## Steps to reproduce 
(you needn't follow these instructions, this has already been done for you)
Add the subtree remote using: `git remote add -f kogito-wiki https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes.wiki.git`

Add the subtree using(creates a commit automatically): `git subtree add --prefix=kogito-wiki https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes.wiki.git master`

Pull the latest updates from subtree: `git subtree pull-all`
